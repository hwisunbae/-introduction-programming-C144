3.GetTenDigitPhone function prompts a user to put 10 digit phone number and if the number of string is not exactly ten, then it will repeat to prompt again until it will satisfy the condition, which is that it has to be ten lengthy string. It reduces the length of the code when it comes to prompt continuously and contributes to the readability in that sense. Just like getTenDigitPhone function, findContactIndex function also contributes to maintainence by checking the difference between the i index in the contact array and cellNum string. 

4.What I learned most from doing assignment second is to use parameters in several codes and utilize them in each modules differently because in contactHelpers.c I had to make different kinds of modules and use them in another file which is contact.c by quoting them at the beginning of files like #include “contactHelpers.h”. Many modules can be used as shortcuts by reducing the size of the main function.
