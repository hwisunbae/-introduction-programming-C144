1. The iterations are for loop, while loop, and do while loop.

2. The most difference is if the condition is checked first or later. In while loop, condition will be checked first; the way while loop works is the same as the for loop. In do while loop, the statement is executed first, and then the condition will be checked.

3. The conditional expression is structured as condition ? operand : operand. If the condition is satisfied, the first operand, which is located between ? and :, will be executed. If it is not, the other operand will be operated.
