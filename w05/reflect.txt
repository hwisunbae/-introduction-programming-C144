1. In terms of daling with related data, an array of structs seems easy to do so rather than using parallel arrays because of its traits. an array can relate any of value in one block; on the other hand, parallel arrays have traits to seperate data into two blocks.

2. Declaring a sturcture works globally; so, a structure may store its declaration in a separate file called a header file that may indicate its brief contents.
