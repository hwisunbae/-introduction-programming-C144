What i have learned in completing this workshop first was how to open the Visual Studio, Notepad, Putty,and WinSCP and store information in those. This workshop made me more get used to using Visual Studio and Putty because i have opened these two application in labs before. For the very first step, opening application and storing what i have worked were mainly handled in this session. In regarding to coding, i have got to make header file and simple code that can show "Welcome to C Programming". Overall, moving files into professor's directory, compling code, and checking if code runs or not in advance has been praticed multiple times.
